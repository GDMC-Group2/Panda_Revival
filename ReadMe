Our new proposal, Panda_Revival, continues the evolving story of the cities our team has created over the years.
First, they built a city on the surface. Then, to escape a series of disasters, they fled underground.
Now, this year, they have returned to the surface once again.
You will receive a booklet containing brief descriptions of each of these cities.
